# ST446 course project

(revised WT 2024)

## Project task

You are free to propose a task for your project. Your proposal must be approved by the course lecturer. Your proposal may either be immediately approved or you may be asked to revise and resubmit your proposal.

Your project should demonstrate that you have acquired a good knowledge of some of the topics on distributed computing for big data covered in the course, with a focus on methodology, distributed computing algorithms and technologies for processing big data and demonstrating performance gains that can be achieved by using distributed computing.

Your implementation would typically be using Spark or possibly some other system, and a dataset suitable for your problem.

Here you may find information about past project topics and links to some references - see [here](./Project-examples.md).

## Group work

Your project is a group project, with each group consisting of 3 or 4 students. **Groups of 2 students are not accepted!**

You are given the freedom to form groups as you like. We will provide some means to facilitate group formation.

You are expected to split the work on your project among yourself. It is expected that each group member to contribute a fair share of technical contributions to the project.

## GitHub

You will be assigned a private repository for your project in the ST446 organisation.

Your entire source code and your project report must be included in this repository.

## Report

### Format of the report

Your report should be formatted according to the [ACM SIG conference proceedings](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty) (two-column format).

Your report should be no longer than **eight** pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Your report may have an appendix containing further details of your work.

### Organisation of the report

The layout of the sections of your report should follow the standard structure of a research paper. Here is an example of a research paper organisation:

* **Abstract** The abstract should contain a summary of your report, covering your chosen task, what is your solution, and what are your main results.

* **Introduction** The introduction should give a clear description of your chosen task, why your task is important, what is your solution, why is your solution an appropriate solution for the given problem, and a summary of the main results.

* **Related work** This section should overview related work for the task that you are trying to solve and position your work against related work. Related work would typically be published in research papers.

* **Methodology** This section should describe the underlying distributed computing methodology deployed for your task.

* **Numerical results** This section should present your numerical evaluation results along with a discussion of the results. First, the goals of the numerical evaluations should be clearly described. Second, the datasets used in the evaluation should be described. Third, any evaluation metrics used in this section should be defined. Fourth, any baseline methods used for comparison should be briefly described. Fifth, and last, numerical results should be presented along with discussion.

* **Conclusion** The conclusion section should summarise the content of the report, followed by a discussion of potential future work to address any limitations of the study or to explore new research avenues.

* **Bibliography** The bibliography lists references cited in your report (it is automatically generated by latex). Your report must cite any references that you used in your research, and give proper credit for any concepts or results introduced in previously published work.

At the end of the report, you should put two statements:
* **Statement about individual contributions**, in which you need to summarise the individual technical contributions of each group member.
* **Statement about the use of generative AI**, in which you should disclose any use of AI tools as per departmental and course policies. Please, check the guidelines on [Moolde](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=5824).
